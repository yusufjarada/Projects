File Structure:
assets - folder containing graphics and other assets for pybullet to run
data - folder where waypoints and cost to goal are stored for a given environment
collisions_utils.py - script to get the collision function
main.py - script to set up experiments and collect data by running PRM algorithm and getting the waypoints using Dijkstra's algorithm

To Run an experiment you must set up the obstacles and specify start and goal configurations and the file path of your data


Checkpoint 2:
Model.py contains model setup
main.py contains PRM used for data and RRT* algorithm

Checkpoint 3:
Same as above, to run RRT* comment line 253 in main.py and uncomment line 254.
To run Learning based RRT* comment line 254 in main.py and uncomment line 253
